# ðŸš€Features
- Receive notification as soon as a new scholarship drops.
- Receive reminder a couple of days before closing date.
- Filtering options

# How it works

 - Occasionally scrape govmu website using Github Actions.
 - Check for updates.
 - If update, update my website, send email and save update to `scrape.json`

# Why not use the govmu website directly ?
- Inconsistent html. (one bullet point had an anchor   tag to it, strong tag nested in anchor or anchor nested in strong tag)
- govmu data contains erratic line breaks, lf/cr chars which had to be removed.
- No filtering options available.
- You will have to manually check the website for updates.
- Inconsistent capitalisation.
