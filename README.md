# ðŸš€Features
- Receive an email notification each time a new scholarship drops.
- Receive reminder a couple of days before closing date.
- Filtering options
- Asynchronous programming, caching dependencies to speed up Github Actions

# How it works

 - Occasionally scrape govmu website using Github Actions.
 - Check for updates.
 - If update, update my website, send email and save update to `scrape.json`

# Why not use the govmu website directly ?
- Inconsistent html. (one bullet point had an anchor   tag to it, strong tag nested in anchor or anchor nested in strong tag)
- govmu data contains erratic line breaks, lf/cr chars which had to be removed.
- No filtering options available.
- You will have to manually check the website for updates.
- Inconsistent capitalisation.

# Assumptions when scraping 
- The first anchor tag in each row is the scholarship name.  (This is not true for Queen Elizabeth)

# ðŸ”¨ To-Do
- [ ] Add above assumption to code
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Save all scraped data to Firestore
- [ ] Try to reduce execution time : remove unused libraries, caching, optimise program, asyncio ...
- [ ] Delete virtual env from github
- [ ] be more stringent when comparing communique

- [ ] Create a registration form so that anyone can subscribe for updates.
- [ ] Add sitemap + request indexing.
- [ ] Add project social media preview.

### âœ” Done
- [x] Add requirements.txt file
- [x] Use Github Actions to automate scraping. [Read this](https://yasoob.me/posts/github-actions-web-scraper-schedule-tutorial/).
