3. In your repository settings, create two [Github repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) named  `EMAIL_PASSCODE` and `SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS` respectively. `EMAIL_PASSCODE` should contain your newly created gmail app password and `SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS` should contain the corresponding gmail account.
