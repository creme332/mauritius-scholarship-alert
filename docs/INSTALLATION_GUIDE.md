## Using Github Actions
Follow the instructions in this section if you only want to use the tool without installing the project locally. 

### Prerequisites
- A Github account
- A Gmail account

### Instructions
1. Fork the repository.
1. Enable two-factor authentication on your Gmail account if not already enabled.
2. Create an [App Password](https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport/?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0015112&sys_kb_id=76433076dbdf8c904cb035623996194b&spa=1) for your account. Keep a copy of this password.
3. In your repository settings, create two [Github repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) named  `EMAIL_PASSCODE` and `SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS` respectively. `EMAIL_PASSCODE` should contain your newly created gmail app password and `SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS` should contain the corresponding gmail account. Do not include quotation marks in text box provided by Github.
